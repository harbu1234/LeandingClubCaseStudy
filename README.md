# Lending Club
> Lending Club Project details:The company provides loans to urban customers and must evaluate applications to balance two risks: losing business by rejecting creditworthy applicants and incurring losses by approving likely defaulters. The dataset includes past applicants' profiles and repayment outcomes. The goal is to identify patterns predicting default to inform decisions like loan denial, adjustment, or higher interest rates for risky applicants.
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
